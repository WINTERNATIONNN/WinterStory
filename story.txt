It was said that during the snow storm, students would go missing at hands of one of UW's own students. THe police could not make a list of suspects. And everyone who encountered the mystery could not describe the event.

This has been going on for years upon years now. Then came along a student named Patrick. He was going to be the change that the university needed. He was going to find the cause of this great mystery and help countless families finally get closure.

Just a few days ago, the police found out that Lake Mendota would swirl students to the bottom during full moon. This mystery was solved by a professor in the College of Engineering. He redesigned the structure of the lake, and peace came back to UW-Madison again.
